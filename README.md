# DAML_time_tracker

### Develop a time tracker application that makes it possible for a user to track time they have spent on various tasks.
 
### Minimal solution

- [ ] Daml model that implements:
    - [ ] creation,
    - [ ] update and
    - [ ] deletion of the representation of time spent
         
- [ ] Required data to be stored:
    - [ ] Description
    - [ ] Start (date)time
    - [ ] End (date)time
    - [ ] A project identifier to allow higher level organization.
      
- [ ] A Daml script that can be used to initialize the ledger with at least one user and a few sample records.
- [ ] A Daml script that does some testing of the templates.
- [ ] To showcase, start a minimal Canton ledger (1 participant node, 1 domain node, single config file) and use the Navigator to show how the template can be used.
`When you run the Sandbox using daml start or daml sandbox, you are effectively starting an in-memory instance of Canton with a single domain and a single participant.`
